"""
SCRIPT FOR ASSOCIATING DOMAINS/NAMES/IPS WITH A LOCATION
LOCATION FIELS ARE GENERATED EACH TIME, LOOK INTO SERIALIZATION
SWITCH STATEMENT FOR DOMAIN COMPARISON IS CLUNKY, LOOK INTO CONFIG FILE

so it works from the command line...who knows here
TODO: figure out how to export the script...
